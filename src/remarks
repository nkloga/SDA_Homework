FirstFactorial:
+    1. use => instead of  > something + 1
+    2. factorial has while???
SecondNumberInput:
+    3. if brackets!
+    !. continue and break, break in while loop breaks from the loop, continue skips all steps after and goes back to while
    !. for(int i = 0; i < 5; ){ // it is possible to change increment inside the for loop
        ....
        i++;
        }
ThirdNumberInput:
+    4. initial values are 0, should be Integer.MAX_VALUE - max int value
FourthNumberInput:
    5. it is possible to add more than 5 negative numbers, counter can go below 0, implement in two separate blocks
        even better to make a method that could be called twice
    !. use TDD for homeworks
FifthMain
    6. refactor, review his code, stack, too many variables, use freeElements variables and initiate other variables in methods
    7. copy doesn't work correctly, add more value to the stack copy, use final?
SixthMain
    8. replace ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException with IllegalStateException, don't show how is it implemented,
    people could make different assumptions, use general
    9. dequeue должно возвращать удаленное значение
